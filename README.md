# FileHasher
Small utility for CRC32 calculation and hashing files using MD5, and various SHA implementations.

Just drag and drop your files or folders on the datagrid and hit Go and it will start calculating.
Preferences menu provides selection to include filepath and any column that is desired.

Results can be exported to CSV, HTML and XML.
Exported HTML has search support but requires internet access because it references Bootstrap, DataTables and JQuery CDN's to make this possible.
